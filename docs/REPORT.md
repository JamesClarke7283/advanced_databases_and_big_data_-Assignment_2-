## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to develop a robust system capable of querying and creating data from both MySQL and MongoDB databases. This project is part of the Advanced Database and Big Data module, focusing on the practical implementation of database management and data processing techniques. By leveraging the strengths of both relational and NoSQL databases, we sought to create a flexible and scalable data management system.

## Implementation

### Database Preparation (Backend)

The backend setup for our project involved preparing both MySQL and MongoDB databases. This preparation included designing schemas, creating tables and collections, importing data, and ensuring efficient querying capabilities. Below, we describe the processes for each database in detail.

#### MySQL Database Setup

We began with the MySQL database, which is a relational database management system known for its reliability and performance in handling structured data. Our primary goal was to create a structured and normalized schema that could efficiently store user information, movie details, and their associated ratings. The steps we followed are outlined below:

1. **Schema Design**:
  
  - **User Table**: This table stores user information such as user ID, name, and email. It is essential for managing user-specific data and ensuring that each user can be uniquely identified. The user ID serves as the primary key to guarantee uniqueness.
  - **Movie Table**: This table contains movie details, including movie ID, title, director, and release year. It is crucial for cataloging the various movies in our database and associating them with user ratings. The movie ID serves as the primary key.
  - **Rating Table**: This table records user ratings for movies, linking the user and movie tables through foreign keys. It captures the rating given by a user to a specific movie, providing valuable data for analysis. The rating table includes columns for user ID, movie ID, and the rating score.
  
  Example schema for the Movie table:
  
  sql
  
  `CREATE TABLE movies ( movieId INT PRIMARY KEY, title VARCHAR(255), director VARCHAR(255), releaseYear INT );`
  
2. **Table Creation**:
  
  - We used SQL scripts to create the tables defined in our schema. Each table was carefully structured to ensure data integrity and efficient relationships between entities. The use of primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints helped maintain the integrity of our data.
    
  - Example SQL script to create the User table:
    
    sql
    
    `CREATE TABLE users ( userId INT PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE );`
    
3. **Data Import**:
  
  - Data was imported from CSV files into the respective tables. We wrote custom scripts to parse the CSV files and load data into the database. This step was crucial for populating our database with initial data and ensuring that the data was accurate and consistent.
    
  - The import scripts ensured data consistency by validating the data before insertion and handling any errors that occurred during the process. This approach minimized the risk of data corruption and ensured that our database maintained high data quality.
    
  - Example Python script for data import:
    
    python
    
    `import csv import mysql.connector conn = mysql.connector.connect( host="localhost", user="root", password="password", database="movies_db" ) cursor = conn.cursor() with open('movies.csv', 'r') as file: reader = csv.reader(file) for row in reader: cursor.execute("INSERT INTO movies (movieId, title, director, releaseYear) VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s)", row) conn.commit() cursor.close() conn.close()`
    
4. **Data Integrity and Constraints**:
  
  - To maintain data integrity, we added constraints such as primary keys, foreign keys, and unique constraints. These constraints ensure that the data remains consistent and that relationships between tables are accurately enforced.
    
  - Example of adding a foreign key constraint to the Rating table:
    
    sql
    
    `ALTER TABLE ratings ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user FOREIGN KEY (userId) REFERENCES users(userId), ADD CONSTRAINT fk_movie FOREIGN KEY (movieId) REFERENCES movies(movieId);`
    

#### MongoDB Database Setup

MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for its flexibility and scalability. Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for more dynamic and varied data storage. This was particularly useful for our project, where the data structures could change over time. The following steps outline our MongoDB setup:

1. **Collection Design**:
  
  - **Users Collection**: Stores user information in a document-oriented format. Each document represents a user, containing fields for user details such as user ID, name, and email. The flexible schema allows for easy addition of new fields without altering the existing structure.
  - **Movies Collection**: Stores movie details in documents, allowing for a flexible schema. Each movie document includes information such as title, director, and release year. This flexibility is advantageous for storing various attributes that may not be uniform across all movies.
  
  Example of a movie document:
  
  json
  
  `{ "title": "Inception", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "releaseYear": 2010 }`
  
2. **Data Import**:
  
  - We used MongoDBâ€™s native tools and scripts to import data from JSON and CSV files. This step involved converting data into the appropriate format for MongoDB and ensuring that the data was clean and ready for efficient querying.
    
  - The data import process involved cleaning and transforming data to fit the NoSQL model. This transformation was necessary to ensure that the data could be stored and retrieved efficiently in MongoDB.
    
  - Example Node.js script for data import:
    
    javascript
    
    `const { MongoClient } = require('mongodb'); async function run() { const client = new MongoClient('mongodb://localhost:27017', { useUnifiedTopology: true }); await client.connect(); const db = client.db('movies_db'); const collection = db.collection('movies'); const movies = [ { title: 'Inception', director: 'Christopher Nolan', releaseYear: 2010 }, { title: 'Interstellar', director: 'Christopher Nolan', releaseYear: 2014 }, // more movie documents ]; await collection.insertMany(movies); client.close(); } run().catch(console.dir);`
    
3. **Indexing**:
  
  - To optimize query performance, we created indexes on frequently queried fields such as `title` and `director`. Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations, making the database more efficient. By indexing these fields, we ensure that search operations are fast and responsive.
    
  - Example of creating an index on the `title` field:
    
    javascript
    
    `await db.collection('movies').createIndex({ title: 1 });`
    
4. **Handling Relationships**:
  
  - Unlike relational databases, MongoDB does not enforce strict relationships between collections. However, we maintained logical relationships through referencing. This approach allowed us to link related documents without enforcing rigid constraints. For example, user documents can reference favorite movie documents by their IDs.
    
  - Example of referencing in MongoDB:
    
    json
    
    `{ "userId": "abc123", "name": "John Doe", "email": "john@example.com", "favoriteMovies": [ { "movieId": "xyz789", "title": "Inception" }, { "movieId": "uvw456", "title": "Interstellar" } ] }`
    

By setting up both MySQL and MongoDB databases with carefully designed schemas and efficient data import processes, we ensured that our system could handle complex queries and data manipulation tasks effectively. This backend preparation laid a strong foundation for the rest of our project.

### Technique (Frontend)

To interact with the databases, we utilized Deno, a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript. The backend services were containerized using Docker, allowing for seamless deployment and management of the database instances. Below, we detail the methods used to interact with both MySQL and MongoDB databases.

#### Querying MySQL

We used Deno to run SQL queries against the MySQL database. The following code snippet demonstrates a query to retrieve user data from MySQL:

javascript

`import { Client } from "https://deno.land/x/mysql/mod.ts"; const client = await new Client().connect({ hostname: "127.0.0.1", username: "root", db: "movies_db", poolSize: 3, // connection limit password: "password", }); const result =`
